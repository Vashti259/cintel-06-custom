## Project Overview
### This project will be about creating a Module 6 App in The PyShiny Posit Playground using the NBA Player Career Comparisons Dashboard Template. 
### We will be exploring Shiny Express API as we build an app that would be a good fit for our Module 6 project.  We will create our App to be used in a browser as we explore various creative packages from both Python and Shiny packages to enhance this app.
### After the formulation of the app we will clone the app to our local machine and activate a .venv for our virtual environment with a .gitignore to balance our project in VScode Python Environment. 
### For the sake of our repository, our .gitignore must keep our .venv in check to avoid any unnecessary upload of this file to our remote repository. We will use git add pull and push to update the app to the repository from the vscode environment.
